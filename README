= Description
  Adds the wait3, wait4, waitid, pause, sigsend, and getrusage methods to
  the Process module. For Ruby 1.8.4 or earlier, it also adds the getrlimit
  and setrlimit methods.

= Installation

  gem install proc-wait3

== Tested Platforms
  * Solaris
  * Linux
  * FreeBSD
  * OS X

= Warnings
  Linux users who compile with gcc -Wall will notice a few warnings. These
  are harmless (and unavoidable atm).

= Applying the mkmf.diff patch
  In order to install this package, you will need to patch your mkmf.rb file
  with the provided diff file.  This is necessary because I need a way to
  determine if certain idtype_t enum (const) values are defined. The patch adds
  a "have_const" method (and does nothing else). See ruby-core:4422 and related
  threads for more information. Also available as ruby-Patches-1486 on the
  RubyForge project page for Ruby.

  To apply the patch, simply run "ruby patch.rb". Note that you may need to be
  root to apply the patch.  This may fail in Ruby 1.8.5 or later.  Since there's
  no good way to make a compatible diff, you will just have to edit the mkmf.rb
  file manually.

= Integration with Ruby's process.c

  I considered simply providing a patch to the core process.c file, but I
  decided against it for two reasons.  First, I wanted to get something
  out more quickly rather than waiting for approval from the core developers
  who, based on an earlier post, seem somewhat gun-shy about integrating support
  for wait3() and wait4() based, I think, on portability concerns.

  Second, and more importantly, I don't like the cProcStatus class.  The
  extra inspection code seems like an awful lot of work for very little gain.
  The overloaded methods are also overkill, and do nothing but save me the
  trouble of typing the word "status", since all they're for is comparing or
  operating on the status attribute.
